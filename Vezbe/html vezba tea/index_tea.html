				<h3>The Legendary Origins of Tea</h3>
					<div id="original">
						
						
						<div id="original1">
						<p><div id="txt1">The history of tea extends so far into the past that its very origins are shrouded by legend. It is said that Emperor Shen Nung who ruled China in 
							2700 BC, used to enjoy relaxing in his garden with a cup of hot water. It was during one of these respites that a tea leaf happened to float down from 
							a nearby bush and land directly in the Emperor's cup.
							The new drink quickly become the Emperor's favorite, and a taste for tea,

							quickly spread throughout the aristocracy, and it wasn't long before tea was the favored drink throughout all of China.<br/>
							It was in the 16th century that Portuguese missionars were seduced by tea's flavor and the intricate customs which surrounded 
							it. A demand for the drink quickly arose, and the Dutch East India Company began importing it into Europe.<br/>
							</div><div id="txt3">It's most likely that it was Japanese green teas which were first to arrive in the west, owing Japan's liberal trade policies with Dutch.
							Initilly, tea was chiefly recommanded to Europeans for it's purported medicinal qualities; it was claimed by the Dutch
							that tea was a cure for nearly every disease imaginable.<br/>
							Due the expense of bringing tea halfway across the globe, it was initially consumed primarlly by aristocrats and the rich. Over 
							time the cost of tea fel enough for people from all walks of life to be able to enjoy it. By 1717 Thomas Twining's English coffe 
							house become a tea shop; and unlike the ubiqutous London coffee house on the era, the dors of Twining's were open to both man and women.
							Meeting	friends over tea became a staple British life, and afternoon tea become a last tradition that still continues today.</div>
